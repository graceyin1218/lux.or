TODO: fun project idea that I don't have time for right now, but want to attempt eventually.
(Not telling you guys what it is yet though ;p )

Brainstorming:
- database? (too slow probably.. and too annoying)
- taking advantage of Google's search engine? (Google restricts automated queries though..)
- machine learning? (hmmm... might work?)
